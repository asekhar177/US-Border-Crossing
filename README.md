# US-Border-Crossing
An analysis of US Border Crossing data from Jan 1996 to Mar 2019.

The data from this project was extracted from https://www.kaggle.com/akhilv11/border-crossing-entry-data/ and the contributors of this project were instrumental in helping me explore new ways to describe my findings. I wouldn't name any one person because they're all wonderful!
